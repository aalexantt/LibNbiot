# paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c

Several parts of paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c are used to implement the MQTT-SN 
protocol functionalities, such as packet packet deserializing/serialiazing. 
paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c implements basic functions of MQTT-SN like publish or 
subscribe blocking. Because this can be a problem in different scenarios, 
especially on RTOS systems, LibNbiot implements the basic MQTT-SN functions
non-blocking by making smaller changes in the original code and by adding 
additional features to the paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c implementation. The smaller 
changes are published under the Eclipse Public License and the additional 
features are published under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
